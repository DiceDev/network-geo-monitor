# Fixes Applied

## ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed

### âœ… 1. Filtered Uninteresting Connections
- **UDP connections to 0.0.0.0:*** and ***:*** are now filtered out
- **Loopback connections** (127.0.0.1 to 127.0.0.1) are filtered out
- **Unspecified addresses** (0.0.0.0:0, *:*) are filtered out
- Added `is_uninteresting()` method to identify these connections

### âœ… 2. Fixed IP Address Truncation
- **Removed truncation** of IP addresses and ports
- **Dynamic column sizing** based on actual content length
- **Full addresses displayed** without cutting off ports
- **Responsive table width** that adapts to terminal size

### âœ… 3. Improved ASN/Organization Data
- **Enhanced online API calls** with better field selection
- **Proper ASN information** from ip-api.com using 'as' field
- **Fallback to multiple services** for better data coverage
- **Reduced reliance on basic lookup** that was showing "Public IP"

### âœ… 4. Better Country Detection
- **Specific country names** instead of generic "Europe"/"Asia"
- **Improved online services** with better country name resolution
- **Enhanced local database usage** when available
- **Better fallback logic** that prefers specific over generic

### âœ… 5. Fixed Connection List Cutoff
- **All connections displayed** without arbitrary limits
- **Scrolling display** for continuous monitoring
- **Dynamic table sizing** to fit all data
- **No connection skipping** in the display

### âœ… 6. Enhanced Filtering Logic
- **Better listening connection detection**
- **Improved state checking** for TCP connections
- **Smart UDP filtering** for stateless connections
- **Comprehensive uninteresting connection filtering**

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Improvements

### Geo Lookup Priority:
1. **Local GeoLite2 databases** (most accurate)
2. **ip-api.com with enhanced fields** (good ASN data)
3. **ipinfo.io as backup** (reliable service)
4. **Basic lookup only for well-known IPs** (minimal guessing)

### Display Improvements:
- **Dynamic column widths** based on content
- **No truncation** of important data
- **Better terminal width detection**
- **Responsive layout** that adapts to screen size

### Connection Filtering:
- **Smart UDP filtering** (removes stateless noise)
- **Loopback filtering** (removes local noise)
- **Listening connection filtering** (optional)
- **Comprehensive uninteresting connection detection**

## ðŸš€ Usage

The script now provides much cleaner, more accurate output:

\`\`\`bash
# Basic usage (recommended)
python network_monitor.py

# Test geo lookup functionality
python test_geo_lookup.py

# Include all connections (even uninteresting ones)
python network_monitor.py --show-listening
\`\`\`

## ðŸ“Š Expected Output

You should now see:
- âœ… **Full IP addresses with ports** (no truncation)
- âœ… **Specific country names** (Germany, not Europe)
- âœ… **Actual ASN/Organization data** (Google LLC, not Public IP)
- âœ… **Clean connection list** (no UDP 0.0.0.0 noise)
- âœ… **All connections displayed** (no cutoff)
